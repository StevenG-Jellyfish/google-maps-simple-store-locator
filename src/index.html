  <h1>Jellyfish Office Google Map with custom pins POC</h1>
  <p>Basic Google Map custom pin fucntionality. Each map pin is pulled in from a stores.json file and is plotted based on hard-coded coords. Coords will need to be generated by the geoCode fucntions and added to the json file or done real time. This file/json will need to be generated from the CRM.  Clicking on the map pin will display the detail card popup for that location.</p>
  <p>The postal code form is not active.  The intention would be to allow user to search by their postal ocde and display the nearest retailers.</p>
  <p>The List view is currently hard coded. The intention would be to generate this list from the same json data the map pins use. Clicking on a list element would center and highlight the map pin.</p>
